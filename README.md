**Elevator Problem
Understanding and planning of the problem: 
In this task we need to get a calls list and find elevator for any call in the optimal way , before we will begin to write the algoritem , we want to present and explain the elevator problem .
-There are some problems:
1.The calls list includes calls of people that want to go down , and calls of people that want to go up.
2.The building may have a many floors.
3.there are maybe many elevators and we need to use them.
4.every elevator has a different speed and "close/ope door time ".
5.we need to fill the calls in the optimal way , but we need to understand what is it the optimal way .
-we will write some example and suggestions that can improve and take us to the optimal way do this calls list:
we wiil want 
1.every person will wait the little time that we can .
2.that the algoritem do as mush as possible of calls in every moment .
3.that one person not wait a long time in relation to other person .
4.if all the elevators will work and this good for the algoritem it's excellent .
